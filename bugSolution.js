```javascript
// Solution:  Identify and remove or adjust conflicting CSS rules. Make sure your Tailwind configuration is correct. 

// Example of removing the conflicting CSS rule:
/* Remove this CSS rule */
div {
  background-color: blue;
}

// Or, make your Tailwind class more specific to override the general rule
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 !important">
  This should have a red background and padding.
</div>

// Ensure your Tailwind CSS is properly configured and compiled.
